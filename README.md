# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Overview

The pattern allows us to create a class for which only one object can be created, providing a global point of access to that instance throughout the application.

## Advantages

1. **Avoid Memory Overhead:**
   - By restricting the instantiation of a class to a single instance, the Singleton Pattern helps avoid unnecessary memory overhead associated with multiple instances.

2. **Maintain Consistency in Data:**
   - Ensures that there is a single source of truth, maintaining consistency in the data managed by the singleton instance.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Database Connection:**
   - In scenarios where establishing a database connection is resource-intensive, a singleton pattern can be used to ensure that only one connection is created and reused throughout the application.

2. **Logger:**
   - Logging is a common use case for the Singleton Pattern. A single logging instance can centralize log entries and control logging behavior.

3. **Configuration Manager:**
   - Managing configuration settings in a centralized manner, ensuring that configuration data is consistent across the application.

## Implementation Example

Here is a simple example of a thread-safe Singleton implementation in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation.
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
