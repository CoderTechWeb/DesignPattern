# Design Patterns Overview

This project leverages a variety of design patterns to enhance flexibility, maintainability, and reusability in software design. The patterns are categorized into Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns.

## Creational Patterns

## Purpose: 
Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

## Focus: 
They focus on how objects are instantiated and composed to form larger structures.

## Examples:

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
   - Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   
2. **Factory Method Pattern:**
   - Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses.
   
3. **Abstract Factory Pattern:**
   - Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

4. **Builder Pattern:**
   - Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
   
5. **Prototype Pattern:**
   - Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

## Structural Patterns

### Purpose: 
Structural patterns deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.

### Focus: 
They focus on simplifying the composition of classes and objects to create more flexible and reusable systems.

1. **Adapter Pattern:**
   - Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

2. **Bridge Pattern:**
   - Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

3. **Composite Pattern:**
    - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

4. **Decorator Pattern:**
    - Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

5. **Facade Pattern:**
    - Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

6. **Flyweight Pattern:**
    - Minimizes memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

## Behavioral Patterns

### Purpose: 
Behavioral patterns deal with the interaction and responsibilities of objects, defining patterns for how they collaborate and communicate.

### Focus: 
They focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other, encapsulating the patterns of communication between objects.

# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Overview

The pattern allows us to create a class for which only one object can be created, providing a global point of access to that instance throughout the application.

## Advantages

1. **Avoid Memory Overhead:**
   - By restricting the instantiation of a class to a single instance, the Singleton Pattern helps avoid unnecessary memory overhead associated with multiple instances.

2. **Maintain Consistency in Data:**
   - Ensures that there is a single source of truth, maintaining consistency in the data managed by the singleton instance.

## Common Use Cases

1. **Database Connection:**
   - In scenarios where establishing a database connection is resource-intensive, a singleton pattern can be used to ensure that only one connection is created and reused throughout the application.

2. **Logger:**
   - Logging is a common use case for the Singleton Pattern. A single logging instance can centralize log entries and control logging behavior.

3. **Configuration Manager:**
   - Managing configuration settings in a centralized manner, ensuring that configuration data is consistent across the application.

## Implementation Example

Here is a simple example of a thread-safe Singleton implementation in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // Private constructor to prevent instantiation.
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

# Builder Design Pattern
## Overview
The Builder pattern provides a simple and safe way to build objects that have many optional parameters, addressing the telescoping constructor problem.

When we have too many parameter setting constructors for each field or a combination of many fields is cumbersome, leading to code complexity like below, which is called the telescoping constructor solution. This is not suitable

```java
public Book(String isbn, String title) {
        this(isbn, title, null);
    }

    public Book(String isbn, String title) {
        this(isbn, title, genre, null);
    }

    public Book(String isbn, String title, String author) {
        this(isbn, title, genre, author, null);
    }

    public Book(String isbn, String title, String author, Year published) {
        this(isbn, title, genre, author, published, null);
    }

    public Book(String isbn, String title, String author, Year published, String description) {
        this.isbn = isbn;
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.published = published;
        this.description = description;
    }
```

## Why Use the Builder Design Pattern?
1. **Flexible Object Construction:**
   - The pattern allows the construction of a complex object to be done step by step, enabling the creation of different representations of the same object.

2. **Clear Separation of Concerns:**
   - Separates the construction process from the actual representation, promoting a clear division of responsibilities between the director, builder, and product.

3. **Easier Maintenance and Extensibility:**
   - Makes it easier to introduce new variants of a product or make changes to the existing construction process without affecting the client code.

4. **Avoids Telescoping Constructors:**
   - Provides a more readable and maintainable alternative to telescoping constructors when dealing with a large number of optional parameters.

# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

```Java

/**
 * Prototype Design Pattern Example
 */

// Step 1: Create a prototype interface
interface PersonPrototype {
    PersonPrototype clone();

    void customize(String name, int age);
    void display();
}

// Step 2: Implement concrete prototype class
class ConcretePerson implements PersonPrototype {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public ConcretePerson() {
        // Default constructor
    }

    private ConcretePerson(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public PersonPrototype clone() {
        return new ConcretePerson(this.name, this.age);
    }

    @Override
    public void customize(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
    }
}

// Step 3: Client code
public class PrototypeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a prototype person
        PersonPrototype prototypePerson = new ConcretePerson();

        // Customize and clone
        PersonPrototype person1 = prototypePerson.clone();
        person1.customize("Alice", 30);

        // Customize and clone again
        PersonPrototype person2 = prototypePerson.clone();
        person2.customize("Bob", 25);

        // Display customized persons
        System.out.println("Person 1:");
        person1.display();

        System.out.println("\nPerson 2:");
        person2.display();
    }
}
```
# Prototype with Registry

## Overview
The Prototype Design Pattern involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, while the Prototype Registry centralizes the management of prototypes. This combination is useful when creating objects involves a costly or complex initialization process.

## Prototype Pattern:
The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that involves creating new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. Instead of using a constructor, objects are cloned to create new instances. This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than copying an existing one.

## Prototype Registry (or Prototype Manager) Pattern:
The Prototype Registry Pattern involves using a registry or manager to keep track of various prototypes. This registry provides a central place to store and retrieve prototype objects. Instead of creating and maintaining instances directly, clients can request instances from the registry.

# Factory Pattern:

The Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It involves a single interface or abstract class with a method for creating objects, and multiple concrete classes that implement this interface to create different types of objects.

# Abstract Factory Pattern:

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It involves multiple interfaces or abstract classes (one for each type of object), each with multiple concrete implementations. The concrete factories produce families of related objects.

## When to use each

Factory Pattern is suitable for creating a single type of object, while the Abstract Factory Pattern is suitable for creating families of related objects with multiple variations. The choice between them depends on the complexity and structure of the objects you need to create in your application.
